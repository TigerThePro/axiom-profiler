All scripts in this directory should be run via Windows PowerShell. 

===========

GetLogs.ps1
-----------
Generates logs from SMT-files using Z3. The logs will be stored in .\logs. Pass the directory containing the SMT-files as an argument. 

Example:
 run "scripts\GetLogs.ps1 .\experiments-subset\Dafny\"

===============
AnalyzeLogs.ps1
---------------
Analyzes logs using the Axiom Profiler. Pass the folder containing the logs as an argument. The results of the analysis will be stored in .\out. The logs containing at least 10 repetitions of some pattern will be copied into .\looping. 

Example: 
 run "scripts\AnalyzeLogs.ps1 .\logs" after generating logs using GetLogs.ps1.

===============



AvgNumQuant.ps1
---------------
Calculates the average number of quantifiers used in a test suite. Pass the .\out directory as an argument. 

Example: 
 run "scripts\AvgNumQuant.ps1 .\out" after analyzing the logs using AnalyzeLogs.ps1. This uses the basic-files generated by AnalyzeLogs.ps1 that contain statistics about the quantifiers in each example.



=============
FindLoops.ps1
-------------
Copies log files containing at least N repetitions of some pattern to .\found-loops. Pass N as an argument and run in the directory that contains .\logs and .\out. 

Example: 
 run "scripts\FindLoops.ps1 6" to find all log files that contain at least 6 repetitions of some pattern after analyzing the logs using AnalyzeLogs.ps1.


==============================
NumInstantiatedQuantifiers.ps1
------------------------------
Counts the number of quantifiers that were instantiated at least once in an SMT-query. The corresponding basic-file generated by the Axiom Profiler (after running AnalyzeLogs.ps1) should be passed as an argument. 

Example: 
 run "scripts\NumInstantiatedQuantifiers.ps1 .\out\-viperproject-dafny-Test-dafny4-Lucas-up.dfy.basic"
